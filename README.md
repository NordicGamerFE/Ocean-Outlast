Content creators that play my pack
 

Ja__boi,
Forsakenally

Ocean Outlast is highly based on skyblock. but based in an ocean world with 100% randomly-generated islands.

Since this is based upon skyblock many of the ores are now gone and only the magical and fossils managed to stay behind.

as the mighty ocean gods punished humans for what they did to Atlantis.

With 900 plus quests and more to come, there is loads of help to beat the pack.
